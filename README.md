Analyzed the **Titanic dataset** to explore survival trends using **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn**.  
This project includes:

- **Data Cleaning:** handled missing values, duplicates, and formatted columns ✅  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** visualized survival patterns by gender, class, age, and fare 📊  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Female passengers had higher survival rates  
  - First-class passengers survived more often  
  - Most passengers were aged 20–40  
  - Higher fares linked to better survival odds
